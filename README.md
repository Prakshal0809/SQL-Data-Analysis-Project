# SQL-Sales-Project


The project involves analyzing data from four .csv files. 

1. order_details

2. orders

3. pizza_types

4. pizzas


I used SQL to address and answer various data analysis questions related to the dataset.
This project is essential for gaining foundational to advanced knowledge of SQL.
